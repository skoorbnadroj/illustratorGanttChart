# illustratorGanttChart

My love/hate relationship with project management tools has led me to try and create a gantt chart creation tool within Illustrator as it's the program I use the most to edit and generate graphics and visual communications. This is also an exercise in learning the Adobe Illustrator scripting API and Javascript more hollistically. 

Currently this is a work in progress, and is not even prepared for use. I will update this README once this script is in a usable state. Features for the future:

* Dialog UI for Task input
* CSV import to automatically input large amounts of Workstream and Task data
* Inter-task dependency flag to force tasks to update when parent task dates are changed
* More to come...

If you're interested in this project, feel free to contact me. Understand that this is a personal project and may only be useful to me. With that said, I'm very collaborative and would love any feedback or constructive criticism.
